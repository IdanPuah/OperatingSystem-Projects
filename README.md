# OperatingSystem-Projects
Worked on various projects focused on core OS concepts like process management, synchronization, and concurrency. Implemented a custom shell, thread management with POSIX threads, and synchronization mechanisms using mutexes and semaphores. These projects deepened my understanding of low-level system programming, process control, and thread safety. Additionally, developed assembly projects centered on string manipulation and low-level operations, enhancing my skills in direct hardware interaction and efficient programming

Operating Systems Projects (C/C++)
Developed a series of projects focused on core operating system concepts, such as process management, concurrency, and inter-process communication. These projects include custom implementations of synchronization mechanisms, shell utilities, and threading models. The work involved hands-on experience with low-level system programming, making use of POSIX APIs, process control, memory management, and thread synchronization techniques like mutexes, semaphores, and condition variables.

Key highlights include:

Shell Implementation: Built a custom command-line interface capable of executing Unix commands, managing environment variables, and handling basic I/O redirection.
Synchronization Mechanisms: Implemented solutions for concurrency issues using threading and synchronization primitives, focusing on multi-threaded applications.
Thread Management: Developed multi-threaded programs using POSIX threads (pthreads) to manage concurrent tasks and ensure proper synchronization between threads.
These projects strengthened my proficiency in system-level programming, with an emphasis on optimizing performance, ensuring thread safety, and handling low-level interactions with the operating system.
