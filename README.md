# OperatingSystem-Projects
Worked on various projects focused on core OS concepts like process management, synchronization, and concurrency. Implemented a custom shell, thread management with POSIX threads, and synchronization mechanisms using mutexes and semaphores. These projects deepened my understanding of low-level system programming, process control, and thread safety.
