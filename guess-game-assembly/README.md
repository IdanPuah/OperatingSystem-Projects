# Guess the Number Game in Assembly

This document provides an overview and explanation of a simple implementation of a "Guess the Number" game in x86-64 assembly language.

## Target of the Code

The target of this code is to implement a console-based number guessing game where:

1. The user is prompted to enter a seed for random number generation.
2. A random number between 1 and 10 is generated based on the seed.
3. The user is given up to 5 attempts to guess the generated number.
4. The program provides feedback on whether the guess is correct or incorrect.
5. If the user fails to guess the number within 5 attempts, the program reveals the correct number.

## Breakdown of the Code

### External Declarations

The code declares external functions such as `printf`, `scanf`, `srand`, and `rand` that are used for output and input operations as well as random number generation.

### Data Section

**`.section .data`**: This section contains variables used in the program.

- `user_config_input`: A space to hold the seed input from the user.
- `user_guess_input`: A space to hold the user's guess.
- `random_number`: A space to hold the generated random number.

### Read-Only Data Section

**`.section .rodata`**: This section contains read-only strings that will be printed to the user.

- `num_fmt`: Format for reading integers.
- `user_config_fmt`: Prompt to enter the configuration seed.
- `user_input_fmt`: Prompt to guess the number.
- `worng_guess_fmt`: Message shown for an incorrect guess.
- `good_guess_fmt`: Message shown for a correct guess.
- `over_fmt`: Message shown when the game is over, displaying the correct number.

### Text Section

**`.section .text`**: This section contains the actual code of the program.

- `main`: The main entry point of the program.

## Code Logic Flow

1. **Setting Up the Stack**: The function prologue sets up the stack frame.

2. **User Input for Seed**:
   - Prompts the user for a seed value for random number generation using `printf`.
   - Reads the seed input using `scanf`.

3. **Random Number Generation**:
   - Calls `srand` with the user-provided seed.
   - Calls `rand` to generate a random number.
   - The random number is converted to a range of 1-10 using modulo operation (`%`).

4. **Guessing Loop**:
   - The program enters a loop allowing the user up to 5 attempts to guess the number:
     - Prints a prompt for the user to enter their guess.
     - Reads the user's guess.
     - Compares the guess to the generated random number:
       - If correct, it displays a congratulatory message and exits the loop.
       - If incorrect, it shows a message and increments the attempt counter.
   - If the user fails to guess correctly within 5 attempts, it displays a game-over message with the correct number.

5. **Cleanup and Exit**: The function epilogue restores the stack and exits the program.

## Summary

Overall, the target of the code is to provide an interactive number-guessing game where the user has limited attempts to guess a randomly generated number, using basic input/output functions from C libraries. The code is structured to ensure the game can be played multiple times with different random numbers based on the user's input seed.
